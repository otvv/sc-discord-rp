<summary>todo list:</summary>

-   ~~better extension UI~~ _(something closer to ChromeOS design)_ :white_check_mark:
-   implement redux
-   faster song progress display _(timer)_
-   stealth mode _(when enabled the extension will not display the current song/author being played)_
-   cover art _(maybe)_

:construction: more to come...
